Salary Calculator

Duration: Weekend Challenge Project

This project was created over a weekend. 

Description:
The Salary Calculator includes a web form which allows the user (e.g. a small business owner) to add their employees' information to a table. Upon submission, the employee information is stored as an object in an array. The employee information found in each object is then appended to a table displayed in the DOM. Users may also remove specific employees from the table with delete buttons included in each row (this action updates the object array as well). Adding to and deleting from the table automatically updates the monthly cost feature found at the bottom of the table. This feature will also alert the user if they have exceeded their monthly budget (set to $20,000) by changing its background color to red.

Because information captured by the form is stored in an array, additional features which utilize this data to perform calculations could easily be added.

Installation
How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example -- Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the .env file.

Create a database named your database name,
The queries in the tables.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
Run npm run server in your terminal
Run npm run client in your terminal
The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!
