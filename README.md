Salary Calculator

Duration: Weekend Challenge Project

Description:
The Salary Calculator includes a web form which allows the user (e.g. a small business owner) to add their employees' information to a table. Upon submission, the employee information is stored as an object in an array. The employee information found in each object is then appended to a table displayed in the DOM. Users may also remove specific employees from the table with delete buttons included in each employee row (this action updates the object array as well). Adding to and deleting from the table automatically updates the monthly cost feature found at the bottom of the table. This feature will also alert the user if they have exceeded their monthly budget (set to $20,000) by changing its background color to red. Because information captured by the form is stored in an array, additional features which utilize this data to perform calculations could easily be added.

Of course the basic structure and styling of this application was constructed using HTML and CSS. However, the pages functionality was built using Javascript, along with jQuery. jQuery was primarily used to collect client data from the DOM, append data to the table, handle click events, and provide interactive feedback to the client (e.g. changing background color when the montly budget is exceeded). Javascript was used to store the client data and carry out any required logic.

This project provided me the opportunity to become aquainted with basic DOM manipulation through the use of jQuery. I also experimented with designing a basic layout using flexbox. It was also a opportunity to confront some of the difficulty associated with styling form and table elements using CSS.
